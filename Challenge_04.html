    <h1>Popular Nigerian Foods</h1>
    <p>
        Most Nigerian foods are a blend of diffrent colored food elements and not only are they often a pleasant sight to behold, they are also equally as delicious. 
        <br>Here are five of the most popular Nigerian dishes;
    </p>
    <h2> 
        <ol>
             <li>Amala and Ewedu</li>
        </ol>         
    </h2>

        <p>
            Amala is a Nigerian food made of dried yam bark or cassava/plantain flour. The yams used to make amala are peeled, cleaned, sliced, dried and pounded into flour locally called <em>alubo</em>. Amala is a morsel food that is best enjoyed when served with <em>ewedu</em>, although a varietry of soups such as <em>efo</em>, <em>ila</em>, <em>obgono</em>, or <em>gbegiri</em> could also be used in its stead.

            <ol start="2">
                 <li>Jollof Rice</li>

            <p>
                Jollof rice is a very common dish in Nigeria with a unique taste. It is a perfect dish for regular nights or special occassions cooked in a flavoured tomato-based broth. This delicious dish can be served with meat or non meat recipes but I enjoy it more with fried plantain.

            <h2> 
                <ol start="3">
                     <li>Pounded Yam and Egusi</li>
                </ol>         
            </h2>

                <p>
                    Pounded yam in a simple definition is simply boiled white yam that has undergone the process of pounding. It is one of the many yam recipes in Nigeria, it is delicious and also very popular. I like it best when served with egusi soup, a thickened soup made from mashed melon seeds.

                    <ol start="4">

                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Semo is a known Nigerian solid food which is eaten by all tribes in Nigeria and can be eaten with various soup such as  vegetable soup, okra, meloon or <em>ogbono</em>, which is my favourite. <em>Ogbono</em> soup, known as <em>apon</em> to the Yoruba people is a slimy and tasty Nigerian dish made with ground dry <em>ogbono</em> seed.

                        <p>
                            Nigerian Beans and Plantain pottage is a kid-friendly, tasty and nutritious meal especially for lunch and dinner. The addition of plantain give the meal a sweet taste that kids love so much and adults also find it palatable.
