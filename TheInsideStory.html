        <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
        <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
        <p id="ohnoes-says">"<strong>Because</strong> I'm <em>always unhappy</em>"</p>
        
        <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
        <p id="winston-says">"Its none of my business"</p>
        <script>
            var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
            for (var i = 0; i < ohnoesSays.length; i++) 
            {
                ohnoesSays[i].innerHTML = "ohnoes-says";

            var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");
            for (var i = 0; i < winstonSays.length; i++)
            {
                winstonSays[i].innerHTML = "winston-says";
            }
        </script>
